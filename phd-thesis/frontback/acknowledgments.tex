\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
I would like to thank my supervisors Prof. Steven Niederer and Dr. Anna Sher for helping me become the scientist I am today. Thank you, Steve, for showing me the way to do good research, for being humble and always straight to the point. Thank you, Anna, for always wanting me to aim for perfection, for caring about every little detail and for your precious advice on the world of pharma. You both have been of inspiration to me, and I will cherish the knowledge you have transmitted to me for years to come.

I would like to thank my examiners
