\begin{remark}{Outline}
    In this chapter, we build an emulator that can map both calcium, sarcomere, tissue and hemodynamics properties to the LV function, using the personalised SHAM rat heart contraction model as simulator. After having characterised the model outputs' sensitivities to model inputs, starting from the healthy reference rat model we create a model of the $20$-week old obese ZSF1 rat, a well-enstablished animal model of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. We then use different sub-groups of input parameters as targets of a re-fitting, history matching procedure, with the aim of recoverying the ZSF1 rat model back to the healthy state. The selected groups of parameters mimick the action of possible calcium-, thin filament-, thick filament-, whole sarcomere-targeting compounds. The implemented framework shows that it is possible to \textit{in silico} efficiently identify possible pharmacological interventions on the sarcomere to treat HFpEF in rats.
