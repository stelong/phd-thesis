\begin{remark}{Outline}
    In this chapter, we describe the heart and how it functions, from single cell excitation through to whole-organ contraction and relaxation (Section~\ref{sec:ch1physiology_of_the_heart}). We then present how the key physiological mechanisms at different biological scales can be modelled using equations of bio-electro-mechanics (Section~\ref{sec:ch1mathematical_modelling_of_the_heart}). Heart failure pathology is then introduced, with emphasis on the two most common phenotypes of the disease, namely when the ejection fraction is reduced and when it is preserved (Section~\ref{sec:ch1heart_failure}). We continue by stating the motivation for the research carried out within this thesis (Section~\ref{sec:ch1motivation_and_goals}), and we conclude with a brief summary (Section~\ref{sec:ch1summary}).

\section{Physiology of the heart}\label{sec:ch1physiology_of_the_heart}
During each heartbeat, the chambers of the heart are activated by an electrical impulse that propagates across the entire tissue. The activation wave is initiated by a group of pacemaking cells, making up the \textit{sino-atrial} (\acs{SA}) \textit{node} and located in the right atrium, and immediately starts activating the atria before reaching the \textit{atrio-ventricular} (\acs{AV}) \textit{node}. The AV node slows down the activation signal before it passes to the \textit{atrio-ventricular bundle}. This allows the atria to fully contract to fill the ventricles with blood before the latter are activated. The activation signal through the AV bundle (which branches in two) spreads throughout the ventricles via the specialised, fast \textit{His-Purkinje} conduction system. The arrival of the activation wave at each cardiac muscle cell causes a depolarisation of the cell membrane that initiates an \textit{action potential} (\acs{AP}). This cellular electrical signal gives rise to a calcium transient that activates the tension generating proteins inside the cell through a process called \textit{excitation-contraction} (\acs{EC}) coupling. This causes the heart walls to contract, pumping blood in and out of the heart and around the body and to the lungs.

\subsection{Cardiac electrophysiology}\label{sec:ch1cardiac_electrophysiology}
The surface membrane of a cardiac cell is called the \textit{sarcolemma}. On either side of the sarcolemma, the intracellular and the extracellular environments consist of ionic solutions. For cardiac electrophysiology the major ion species are sodium (\acs{Na}), potassium (\acs{K}), chloride (\acs{Cl}) and calcium (\acs{Ca}). An important property of the sarcolemma is its ability to maintain concentration gradients, such that each ion species is unevenly distributed between the intracellular and extracellular space, resulting in concentration gradients across the membrane. As ions are charged particles, their uneven distribution across the sarcolemma also creates an electrical gradient. The resulting electrochemical gradient provides a driving force to move ions across the cell membrane.

\vspace{0.2cm}
Another crucial property of the sarcolemma is its capacity to respond to electrical stimulation through the brief dynamic opening and closing of highly specific ion channels and electrogenic transporters to produce changes in its transmembrane potential. With each heartbeat, the cell membrane is depolarised and an AP is initiated as a result of a complex interplay of multiple ion channels, exchangers and transporters in the myocardium. A typical AP consists of five phases, each one associated with the opening of specific sarcolemma ion channels. The main ionic events at each AP phase can be summarised as follows.

\begin{description}
	\item[\textsc{Phase $0$.}] The initial depolarisation is due to opening of voltage-gated fast $\Na$ channels ($I_{Na}$) when the transmembrane voltage reaches the activation threshold of the channel between $\SI{-70}{}$ and $\SI{-60}{\milli\volt}$. Positive charged $\Na$ current flows rapidly into the cell due to the large $\Na$ concentration gradient and the negative transmembrane potential, leading to further depolarisation.
	\item[\textsc{Phase $1$.}] The early repolarisation of the AP is primarily caused by the rapidly activating and inactivating transient outward $\K$ current ($I_{to}$).
	\item[\textsc{Phase $2$.}] A plateau phase follows, resulting from a prolonged influx of $\Ca$ ions, as the voltage-gated L-type $\Ca$ channels ($I_{CaL}$) open upon depolarisation. This flow of $\Ca$ ions plays a crucial role in cardiac EC coupling, as it initiates a series of intracellular events that ultimately lead to myocardial contraction. Another current that contributes to the late Phase 2 plateau is the net inward current through the $\Na$/$\Ca$ \textit{exchanger} (\acs{NCX}) in $\Ca$ extrusion mode. This exchanger is a reversible counter-transport system that, when in forward ($\Ca$ extrusion) mode, uses the energy provided by the inward flux of $\Na$ ions down their electrochemical gradient to extrude $\Ca$ ions with a generally accepted stoichiometry of $3\colon 1$, thus moving one net charge into the cell. These two inward currents that determine the AP plateau are balanced by a reduced outward $\K$ current due to the membrane $\K$ conductance falling upon depolarisation. This phenomenon is called \textit{inward rectification}, caused by the obstruction of the inner mouth of $\K$ channels at higher voltages.
	\item[\textsc{Phase $3$.}] The outward flow of $\K$ ions is the major factor causing repolarisation that determines the duration of the AP. The large number of $\K$ channels can be divided into two molecular families: the voltage-gated channels and the inward rectifier channels. The voltage-gated outward $\K$ channels are the rapidly ($I_{Kr}$) and slowly ($I_{Ks}$) activating delayed rectifiers, and are responsible for repolarisation, fully activated at around $\SI{-10}{\milli\volt}$ and deactivated by full repolarisation. The inward rectifier $\K$ channels, such as the time-independent $\K$ current $I_{K1}$, help regulating the resting membrane potential and contribute to late Phase $3$ repolarisation.
	\item[\textsc{Phase $4$.}] $I_{K1}$ closes upon depolarisation and reopens during repolarisation to help terminate the AP and reset the membrane potential to the resting state, which for non-pacemaker cardiac cells such as the ventricular myocytes is around $\SI{-90}{mV}$. An important contribution to maintain resting membrane potential ionic homeostasis is given by the $\Na$/$\K$ \textit{ATPase} (\acs{NAK}). This is a key transporter and uses energy (in the form of \textit{adenosine triphosphate} (\acs{ATP})) to establish a low intracellular $\Na$ concentration and a high intracellular $\K$ concentration by moving $3$ $\Na$ ions out and $2$ $\K$ ions into the cell by hydrolisation of $1$ ATP molecule. This transport is \textit{electrogenic}, meaning that it results in the extrusion of $1$ net charge per cycle.
\end{description}

\begin{figure}[!ht]

    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/chapter01/AP_phases.pdf}
    \caption{The five phases of an action potential in left ventricular myocytes.}
    \label{fig:my_label}
\end{figure}

\vspace{0.2cm}
Every ventricular myocyte is in general not excitable (\textit{refractory}) between Phase $0$ through to half way through Phase $3$, meaning that the cell cannot produce another AP. This is due to all the $\Na$ channels moving to the \textit{inactivated} state after the initial Phase $0$ depolarisation. The period of time since the cell was last activated and it is unable to initiate another activation is called \textit{absolute refractory period}. However, cell \textit{hyperpolarisation} due to $\K$ ions leak which makes the membrane potential being more negative than the resting configuration makes the $\Na$ channels reset to the still closed but not inactivated state. In this moment (\textit{relative refractory period}), the cell can potentially evoke a new AP, although needing a larger-than-normal excitatory stimulus.

% \vspace{0.2cm}\noindent
% Myocytes' non-excitability has two major implications. The first one concerns the spread of excitation through the heart which is brought about by local electrical currents that act ahead of the action potential. In the depolarised, active region the membrane interior is positively charged, while the resting region ahead is negatively charged. The two internal active and resting regions are connected through a fast conductive pathway so that positive charge can flow to the resting membrane region, depolarising it. Conversely, in the extracellular space positive charge flows from the resting membrane region to the active region. When in the resting region the membrane potential reaches the threshold for voltage-gated $\Na$ channels opening (Phase $0$), the active region is still in its refractory period, therefore the excitation can only proceed unidirectionally. The second major implication concerns myocyte contraction. As we shall see in Section~\ref{sec:ch1cardiac_cellular_contraction}, cell contraction takes place in response to an increase in intracellular $\Ca$ concentration (\acs{Cai}). The peak mechanical event (maximal contraction) is achieved after the peak chemical event (maximal $\Cai$) which is achieved after the peak electrical event (maximal membrane potential). More specifically, peak tension is reached during the AP absolute refractory period while the myocyte relaxes during the AP relative refractory period, so that tension development is completed before the myocyte becomes excitable again. The contractile behaviour of the heart is thus restricted to repeated single \textit{twitches}, preventing life threatening sustained myocardial contractions.

% In cardiac myocytes electrical activation elicits an intracellular calcium transient, that in turn signals contraction. % Following activation, the L-type Ca channel opens, causing Ca ions to enter the diadic space. Ca ions then bind to  Ryry causing ca induced Ca release from the SR through RyR. Ca diffuses into the cytosol and binds to and actviates the sarcomere. Then as the cell relaxes cytosolic Ca is pumped back up in the SR thrugh SERCATPase and across the cell membrane through the sodium calcium exchaner and Ca pump.

\subsubsection{The role of calcium in sarcomere contraction}\label{ch1:the_role_of_calcium_in_sarcomere_contraction}
Calcium plays a key role in signalling the cardiac cell to contract. The variation of $\Ca$ levels observed inside the cell during each heart beat is referred to as the \textit{calcium transient} or \textit{calcium signal}. To understand the $\Ca$ dynamics that give rise to the characteristic $\Cai$ transient shape, we need to introduce other important structural and functional myocyte components.

\vspace{0.2cm}
Cardiac myocytes have a long cylindrical shape. The sarcolemma encapsulating the cell invaginates and forms an extensive tubular network called \textit{transverse} (\acs{T}) \textit{tubules} which allows the AP to penetrate rapidly to the interior of the cell. Next to the T-tubules inside the cell lies the terminal cisternae of the \textit{sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum} (\acs{SR}), forming a closely coupled structure called a \textit{dyad}. Within the dyad, $\Ca$ ions movement takes place via the L-type $\Ca$ channels located on the T-tubules and via the \textit{ryanodine receptors} (\acs{RyR}s), which are $\Ca$ release channels located on the SR. The SR contains a store of $\Ca$ ions, which are partially released into the \textit{sarcoplasm} (another name for the cytoplasm within the sarcolemma) when the cell is excited. As the AP travels along the sarcolemma and along the T-tubules, $\Ca$ enters the cell through the L-type $\Ca$ channels during Phase $2$ of the action potential. $\Ca$ then binds to and activates the RyRs, triggering further release of a much greater number of $\Ca$ ions from the SR. This process is termed \textit{calcium-induced calcium release}. $\Ca$ diffuses from the dyadic space into the cytosol, and then on the sarcomeric proteins which make up the contractile machinery, activating contraction.

\vspace{0.2cm}
As $\Ca$ is removed from the cytosol, $\Cai$ decreases so that $\Ca$ dissociates from the sarcomeric proteins, causing the sarcomere to relax. $\Ca$ removal is achieved either via $\Ca$ extrusion from the cell or $\Ca$ uptake into intracellular $\Ca$ stores. Two mechanisms are known to be responsible for the extrusion of $\Ca$ from the cell: NCX and the \textit{plasma membrane} $\Ca$ \textit{ATPase} (\acs{PMCA}). The majority of the $\Ca$ entering the cytosol during a $\Cai$ transient is taken up back into the SR via the \textit{sarcoplasmic} $\Ca$ \textit{ATPase} (\acs{SERCA}), with $2$ $\Ca$ ions transported into the SR for every $1$ ATP molecule consumed, returning the cardiac myocyte to its resting state.

\subsection{Cardiac cellular contraction}\label{sec:ch1cardiac_cellular_contraction}
The basic contractile unit of each myocyte is called the \textit{sarcomere} and is mainly composed of filamentous proteins (\textit{myofilaments}) between thin partitions called \textit{Z disks}. The two principal interdigitating myofilaments are predominantly composed, respectively, of \textit{myosin} protein (\textit{thick filament}) and of \textit{actin} protein (\textit{thin filament}). The thin filament consists of two actin strings arranged as a two-stranded helix. The groove between the actin strands contains two regulatory proteins: \textit{tropomyosin} (\acs{Tn}) and \textit{troponin} (\acs{Tm}). The sarcomere also contains spring-like filaments of \textit{titin}, connecting Z disks. They ensure that myosin filaments stay aligned and they confer elasticity to the heart wall along with the extracellular \textit{collagen}.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \myfloatalign
    \includegraphics[width=0.66\textwidth]{figures/chapter01/fig5.png}
    \caption{Proteins' organisation within the sarcomere. Adapted from~\cite{Guyton:2021}, Unit II, Chapter 6, Page 81, Figure 6-3. Copyright $\textcopyright$ 2021 by Elsevier, Inc.}
    \label{fig:my_label3}
\end{figure}

\vspace{0.2cm}
In the heart, contraction is initiated by a rise in $\Cai$. $\Ca$ binds to the calcium-binding subunit of Tn, namely \textit{troponin C} (\acs{TnC}), on the thin filament, which causes Tm to move out of the actin groove exposing actin binding sites. The thick filament, made of many myosin molecules, has its main body composed by centrally aligned myosin \textit{tails} and with protruding myosin \textit{heads} exposed: these myosin heads now bind to the exposed actin binding sites. Contraction then follows as described by the \textit{sliding filament theory}. The attached myosin heads rotate in the \textit{power stoke}, pulling the thick filaments past the thin filaments, causing the sarcomere to contract. The myosin heads then unbind and can reattach to actin to further contract the sarcomere. The acto-myosin bond which is formed through attachment of myosin heads on the actin filament is called a \textit{cross-bridge}, and constitutes an independent generator of force: the force generated within the entire sarcomere is therefore proportional to the number of attached myosin heads. Coordinated myocyte contraction in the heart is responsible for the rhythmic pumping of blood.

\subsection{Cardiac physiologic anatomy}\label{sec:ch1cardiac_physiologic_anatomy}
The heart is composed of two muscular pumps, the right and left ventricles (\acs{RV}, \acs{LV}), each one filled from a contractile reservoir, respectively the right and left atria (\acs{RA}, \acs{LA}). Atrial and ventricular cells are the two major types of cardiac muscle along with His-Purkinje system cells, although the latter are mainly responsible for controlling the rhythmical beating of the heart rather than generating tension. Cardiac muscle cells take the name of \textit{cardiomyoctytes}. As we will not deal with skeletal muscle in this thesis, we will refer to them as simply \textit{myocytes} with no ambiguities.

\vspace{0.2cm}
In the heart, myocytes are joined together at their ends by \textit{intercalated discs}. At the intercalated discs, each myocyte effectively connects to a network of electrochemically coupled cells (\textit{syncytium}). This is due to the presence of \textit{gap junctions} where the membranes of two interfacing cells almost fuse with one another, allowing rapid diffusion of ions. Myocytes are arranged with a preferred direction. Groups of aligned myocytes are generally referred to as \textit{fibres}. The aligned myocytes are then formed into \textit{sheets}, and many sheets form the main layer of the heart walls, namely the \textit{myocardium}, encapsulated within the \textit{endocardium} (internal layer) and the \textit{epicardium} (external layer). The sheets spread within the myocardium in many different and specific directions resulting in the heart contracting in a twisting motion, thereby maximising the amount of blood ejected from the ventricles. The epicardium is the visceral layer of a more complex structure called \textit{pericardium}, which surrounds the heart, conferring both structural and mechanical stability and lubrication.

\vspace{0.2cm}
The atria and the ventricles are two distinct functional syncytia, meaning that activation in the atria does not directly pass to the ventricles: this is mediated by the AV bundle (Section~\ref{sec:ch1physiology_of_the_heart}). The two syncytia are in fact separated by fibrous, non-conductive tissue surrounding two openings called \textit{atrio-ventricular valves}. AV valves physically connect the \textit{blood pools} or \textit{chambers} in the left and the right heart enclosed within the atrial and ventricular syncytia. The heart chambers are further connected to the arterial \textit{pulmonary circulation} and \textit{systemic circulation} through the \textit{pulmonary} and \textit{aortic valves}, respectively, and to the venous pulmonary and systemic circulation via four \textit{pulmonary veins} and via the \textit{inferior} and \textit{superior venae cavae} and \textit{coronary sinus}, respectively. The LV chamber is further connected to heart muscle itself through \textit{coronary arteries}, which transport oxygen-rich blood to the heart to function as for all the other tissues and organs in the body. 

\vspace{0.2cm}
The series of cardiac events that occur in the time frame that goes from the beginning of one heart beat until the beginning of the next are called \textit{cardiac cycle}.


%
%
%
\subsection{Cardiac cycle}\label{sec:ch1cardiac_cycle}
The cardiac cycle consists of a period of relaxation called \textit{diastole}, during which the ventricles are filled with blood from the atria, followed by a period of contraction called \textit{systole} when the blood is ejected from the ventricles to the lungs, the heart tissue itself and the rest of the body. At each moment of the cardiac cycle, the amount of blood in the heart remains approximately constant, although differently distributed among the four chambers.

\vspace{0.2cm}
Venous blood flows through the systemic and pulmonary venous system major vessels (Section~\ref{sec:ch1cardiac_physiologic_anatomy}) to the RA and LA, respectively. Following spontaneous depolarisation of the SA node myocytes, atria are activated and start contracting, pumping blood into the ventricles. Atrial contraction thus serves as primer pump to ventricular \textit{filling}. The volume of blood in a ventricle at the end of its filling is called \textit{end-diastolic volume} (\acs{EDV}), while the corresponding chamber pressure is called \textit{end-diastolic pressure} (\acs{EDP}). Atrial systole is followed by ventricular systole. A sharp rise in ventricular pressure above the atrial pressure makes the AV valves close by a reversed pressure gradient, preventing retrograde blood flow. The ventricles are activated with the aortic valve closed. The myocardium begins to generate tension but must raise the ventricle pressure to be high enough to overcome the aortic pressure. During this time, the ventricle pressure rapidly increases, but the volume remains constant and is referred to as the \textit{isovolumetric contraction} (\acs{IVC}) period. When the ventricular pressure exceeds the arterial pressure, this makes the aortic and pulmonary valves open, causing \textit{ejection} of blood from the ventricles. The ejected blood volume also called \textit{stroke volume} (\acs{SV}) is only about two-thirds of the available EDV of blood: a residual blood volume, namely the \textit{end-systolic volume} (\acs{ESV}), remains. The proportion of ejected blood, i.e. SV divided by EDV, takes the name of \textit{ejection fraction} (\acs{EF}). The rate of ventricular blood ejection is initially rapid and then progressively slows down. Since the rate at which the aortic blood is draining away into the peripheral circulation now exceeds ventricular ejection, ventricular pressure also begins to fall until reaching the \textit{end-systolic pressure} (\acs{ESP}) when the outflow valves close. At this point, both the ventricles become closed chambers again, and a rapid pressure fall occurs driven by the elastic recoil of the deformed and relaxing myocardium. This process takes place at constant blood volumes and is called \textit{isovolumetric relaxation} (\acs{IVR}). When the intraventricular pressures decrease back to their low diastolic levels, the AV valves open and blood floods in from the atria (which have themselves been filling up during ventricular systole), and the next cardiac cycle begins.

\vspace{0.2cm}
To summarise, isovolumetric contraction, ejection, isovolumetric relaxation and filling are the $4$ main phases of the cardiac cycle (Figure~\ref{fig:wiggersdiagram}).

\section{Mathematical modelling of the heart}\label{sec:ch1mathematical_modelling_of_the_heart}
Biophysically detailed mathematical models of cardiac physiology have been developed to reproduce \textit{in silico} the cardiac function at different biological scales, from the cell up to the whole organ. These models can provide insight into the pathophysiology of complex cardiovascular diseases and help interpret clinical observations to improve patients' treatment.


%
%
%
\subsection{Cell electrophysiology}\label{sec:cell_ep_modelling}
Models of cardiac cells' electrophysiology began with the work of Noble in 1962~\cite{Noble:1962}, who created the first computational model of the long-lasting action and pace-maker potentials of Purkinje fibres of the heart. He continued on the pioneering work of Hodgkin and Huxley~\cite{Hodgkin:1952}, who in 1952 modelled $\Na$, $\K$ and leakage currents that give rise to dynamic changes in membrane potential and hence the AP across the surface membrane of a squid giant nerve fibre. 

\vspace{0.2cm}
Hodgkin and Huxley, and then Noble, modelled the sarcolemma as an electrical circuit (\textit{equivalent circuit model}), comprised of a capacitor in parallel with resistors that represented ionic currents. The total membrane current was given as the sum of the capacitive current and the ionic current:
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:membranecurrent}
I_m = C_m\,\der{V_m}{t} + I_i\,,\quad\text{with}\quad I_i = \sum_{\textrm{ion}}I_\textrm{ion}
\end{equation}

\noindent
where

\vspace{0.2cm}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
    $I_m$            & total membrane current \\
    $I_i$            & total ionic current, i.e. sum of all ionic currents $I_\textrm{ion}$ with sign \\
    & (negative, positive for inward, outward currents, respectively) \\ 
    $C_m$            & cell membrane capacitance per unit area \\
    $V_m$            & transmembrane voltage
\end{tabular}

\vspace{0.2cm}\noindent
and for each ion species the corresponding transmembrane current $I_{\textrm{ion}}$ was described by the \textit{Ohm's law} as:
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ohmslawsinglechannel}
    I_{\textrm{ion}} = g_{\textrm{ion}}\,(V_m-E_{\textrm{ion}})
\end{equation}

\noindent
where

\vspace{0.2cm}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
    $g_{\textrm{ion}}$ & average channel conductance \\
    $E_\textrm{ion}$ & equilibrium potential of the ion
\end{tabular}

\vspace{0.2cm}\noindent
The equilibrium potential of a given ion species is the electric potential that would be required to maintain a zero net ion flux if the ion was allowed to diffuse down to its concentration gradient, assuming the cell membrane is permeable to only that ion species. The \textit{Nernst equation} expresses the equilibrium potential of a ion as a function of the ion concentrations inside and outside the cell:
%
\begin{equation}
    E_{\textrm{ion}}=\frac{\textrm{R}\textrm{T}}{\textrm{F}z}\,\ln{\frac{[\textrm{ion}]_{e}}{[\textrm{ion}]_{i}}}
\end{equation}

\noindent
where

\vspace{0.2cm}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
    $\textrm{R}$  & gas constant \\
    $\textrm{T}$  & absolute temperature \\
    $\textrm{F}$  & Faraday's constant \\
    $z$           & ion valency \\
    $[\textrm{ion}]_{i}$  & ion intracellular concentration \\
    $[\textrm{ion}]_{e}$  & ion extracellular concentration \\
\end{tabular}

\vspace{0.4cm}
Since Noble's initial work, many ionic cell models have been developed to represent the baseline physiology of both atrial, ventricular, and SA node myocytes~\cite{Corrado:2020}. These models all share the same cell membrane modelling strategy by viewing it as an electric circuit (equation~\eqref{eq:membranecurrent}), and mostly differ in single ion channels' kinetics representation.

\vspace{0.2cm}\noindent
The current $I_{\textrm{ion}}$ introduced in equation~\eqref{eq:membranecurrent} is the result of ions moving across the cell membrane through an ion channel, which is made of pore-forming proteins that span the membrane lipid bi-layer. Ion channels are regulated by one or more \textit{gates}, which allow ions to pass according to whether they are in an open or closed state. Changes in an ion channel conformation takes place in response to chemical or electrical signals, temperature, or mechanical stress. Cardiac cells ion channels are mostly \textit{voltage-gated}, meaning that they change conformation with varying transmembrane voltage. Two approaches are commonly being used to represent ionic channels kinetics: the first uses the Hodgkin-Huxley (\acs{HH}) formulation~\cite{Hodgkin:1952} while the second (a generalisation of the first) uses continuous-time Markov chain models (\acs{MM})~\cite{Fink:2009}.

\vspace{0.2cm}
In the HH characterisation of channels, the conductance $g_{ion}$ (equation~\eqref{eq:ohmslawsinglechannel}) is given by the product of a maximal conductance term and one or more separate \textit{gating variables} that represent the probability of finding the channel open:
%
\begin{equation}
    g_{\textrm{ion}} = g_{\textrm{ion}}^{\textrm{max}}\times y_i\cdot\dots\cdot y_N
\end{equation}

\noindent
where each gating variable $y:=y_i$ can be formulated using the equation:
%
\begin{equation}
    \der{y}{t} = \frac{y_{\infty}-y}{\tau_y}
\end{equation}

\noindent
where

\vspace{0.5cm}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
$y_{\infty}$ & voltage-dependent steady-state function of the gate \\
$\tau_{y}$ & voltage-dependent time constant
\end{tabular}

\vspace{0.5cm}\noindent
The gating variables described in the HH formulation do not represent specific kinetic states of the ion channel. Moreover, they are assumed to be independent.

\vspace{0.2cm}
To explicitly describe the dependence of a given transition on the occupancy of different states for a given channel, MMs are used. In this case, a discrete number of states represent the possible configurations a channel has. Transitions from one state to the other can occur at different rates, and the rate zero is used by convention when no direct switching between two given states is possible. Gating variables will then simply represent the probability of finding the channel in the respective states (\textit{state variables}). An example of the MM approach to model an ion channel which can be either in the open, closed or inactivated configuration includes $3$ state variables to represent the three possible configurations and $6$ transition rates. Variation of state $y_i$ is given as a function of the other state variables $y_j$ for $j\in\{1,2,3\}\setminus{\{i\}}$:
%
\begin{equation}
    \der{y_i}{t} = \sum_{\substack{j=1 \\ j\neq i}}^{3} (k_{ji}\,y_j-k_{ij}\,y_i)
\end{equation}

\noindent
were $k_{ji}\in\mathbb{R}$ is the rate at which transition from state $y_j$ to state $y_i$ occurs.

\vspace{0.5cm}
It is worth mentioning that the two presented HH and MM modelling frameworks are not mutually exclusive but are instead very frequently used in combination to represent the many different ion channels within the cell.

\subsection{Cell contraction}\label{sec:cell_contr_modelling}
Cardiac contraction models are used to simulate active tension generation at the sarcomere level arising from the thin and thick filaments. Development of these models has proceeded over the years in parallel with key experimental discoveries about striated and cardiac muscle physiology~\cite{Niederer:2019}. Contraction models have transitioned from simple phenomenological models aiming to represent the average sarcomere dynamics to very complex, spatially detailed models trying to capture the explicit positions of individual molecules. However, in the view of incorporating these models within whole-organ computational frameworks, currently adopted sarcomere contraction models have achieved a balance between recapitulating the main mechanistic phenomena while still being represented by a tractable number of ordinary differential equations (\acs{ODE}s) to remain computationally efficient to solve. Key mechanisms that are desirable to recapitulate in these multi-scale sarcomere contraction models include force dependence on sarcomere length (\textit{Frank-Starling mechanism}), myofilament cooperative activation by $\Ca$, acto-myosin cooperative interaction in cross-bridges formation and force dependence on sarcomere length variation (velocity).


%

%
\subsection{Electromechanical coupling}\label{sec:mathelecmechcoupl}
In biophysically detailed models of cardiac electromechanics, the active tension along the muscle fibres direction is calculated using sarcomere contraction models, introduced in Section~\ref{sec:cell_contr_modelling}. This calculation is normally performed in two steps. The first step consists in solving a system of ODEs of the form:
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:epmechcoupling}
    \der{\mathbf{y}}{t} = f(t,\,\lambda,\,\dot{\lambda},\,\mathbf{y}) 
\end{equation}

\noindent
where $f$ is a non-linear function and

    $t$             & time \\
    $\lambda$       & fibre strain \\
    $\dot{\lambda}$ & fibre strain rate ($=\mathrm{d}\lambda / \mathrm{d}t$) \\
    $\mathbf{y}$    & vector of state variables
\end{tabular}

\vspace{0.2cm}\noindent
In the second step, active tension ($T_a$) is calculated as a function of time, fibre strain and strain rate and state variables which are varying over time, via a non-linear function $h$:
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:activetensioncalc}
    T_a = g(t,\, \lambda,\,\dot{\lambda},\,\mathbf{y}) \\
\end{equation}

\vspace{0.2cm}
The coupling between the electrical and mechanical components of the model resides in the definition of the vector of state variables $\mathbf{y}$. This is in part given by cell electrophysiology model components (e.g. gate and/or state variables) and in part given by cell contraction model components (e.g. variables representing sarcomeric proteins kinetics). The variation in the second set of $\mathbf{y}$ vector components can depend on the current state of the first set of components via the action of function $f$. Furthermore, the electromechanical coupling takes place when the solution of equation~\eqref{eq:epmechcoupling} ($\mathbf{y}$) enters the calculation of the active tension in equation~\eqref{eq:activetensioncalc} through the function $g$.

\subsection{Tissue electrophysiology}\label{sec:tissue_ep_math_modelling}
A tissue model of cardiac electrophysiology is required to link cellular excitation through to whole organ electrical activation.

\vspace{0.2cm}
When a single cardiac myocyte undergoes depolarisation, the evoked AP travels in the form of a depolarisation wave which is able to activate the neighbouring cells. We have seen that cardiac myocytes are microscopically organised into fibres, and further organised into sheets (Section~\ref{sec:ch1cardiac_physiologic_anatomy}). This spatial arrangement causes an anisotropic propagation of the depolarisation wavefront, which is faster along the principal axis of the fibre and slower in the other directions. Different factors can affect propagation, including the shape of the myocytes, the curvature of the wavefront, the relative positions of the gap junctions within the fibres, the extracellular matrix composition and the local vasculature~\cite{Clayton:2011}. In the $3$-dimensional ventricular tissue, the AP depolarisation wave propagation is mainly orthogonal, with the fibre, sheet, and sheet-normal being the three principal directions.

\vspace{0.2cm}
Cardiac tissue electrophysiology can be mathematically described by first considering the tissue as a syncytium of electrically coupled cells, and successively homogenising it to treat it as a smooth, continuos space. In the \textit{bidomain model}, both the intracellular (subscript $i$) and the extracellular (subscript $e$) spaces are considered as smooth and overlapping domains, separated by the cell membrane. The electric current densities in the two domains are described by the Ohm's law as:
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ohmslaw}
    \mathbf{J}_{\text{d}} = -\mathbf{G}_{\text{d}}\nabla\phi_{\text{d}}\,,\quad\text{with}\quad \text{d}=i,\,e
\end{equation}

\noindent
where

\vspace{0.2cm}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
    $\mathbf{\mathbf{J}_{\text{d}}}$ & current density \\
    $\mathbf{G}_{\text{d}}$ & conductivity tensor \\
    $\phi_{\text{d}}$ & electric potential \\
\end{tabular}

\vspace{0.2cm}\noindent
Conservation of current and charge is then enforced:
%
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        & \nabla\cdot\mathbf{J}_i = -I_m \\
        & \nabla\cdot\mathbf{J}_e =  I_m \\
    \end{aligned}\quad\Rightarrow\quad \nabla\cdot(\mathbf{J}_i+\mathbf{J}_e) = 0
\end{equation}

\noindent
where $I_m$ is the cell membrane current calculated as in equation~\eqref{eq:membranecurrent} using an ionic cellular model (Section~\ref{sec:cell_ep_modelling}), and additionally scaled by a factor $\beta_m$ to match the domains' $3$-dimensional nature:
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:membranecurrentsc}
    I_m = \beta_m\left(C_m\,\der{V_m}{t} + I_i\right)
\end{equation}

\noindent
The transmembrane voltage can be expressed in terms of electric potentials as
%
\begin{equation}
    V_m = \phi_i - \phi_e
\end{equation}

\noindent
so that the final set of equations describing the bidomain model takes the following form:
%
\begin{align}\label{eq:bidomainmodel}
    & \nabla\cdot(\mathbf{G}_i(\nabla V_m + \nabla \phi_{\text{e}})) = \beta_m\left(C_m\,\der{V_m}{t} + I_i\right) \\
    & \nabla\cdot((\mathbf{G}_i + \mathbf{G}_e)\nabla \phi_e) = -\nabla\cdot(\mathbf{G}_i\nabla V_m)
\end{align}

\noindent
The system is solved using the finite element method with no-flux conditions at the computational domain boundaries (\textit{Neumann boundary conditions}). $\mathbf{G}_i$ and $\mathbf{G}_e$ conductivity tensors' components are taken to reflect the anisotropy of the cardiac tissue.


%
%
%
\subsection{Tissue mechanics}\label{sec:tissue_mech_math_modelling}
A tissue model of cardiac mechanics is required to link cellular active contraction models through to whole organ pump function. For the modelling of the mechanical properties of cardiac tissue non-linear solid mechanics is used.

\vspace{0.2cm}
Like electrical properties, tissue mechanical properties depend on the orientation of cardiac tissue microstructure. Therefore, to mathematically describe cardiac tissue deformations, tensors are commonly given in terms of a coordinate system locally aligned with the muscle fibre ($\mathbf{f}$), sheet ($\mathbf{s}$) and sheet-normal directions ($\mathbf{n}$) in the reference configuration, determining the orthonormal matrix $\mathbf{L} = [\mathbf{f}\,\mathbf{s}\,\mathbf{n}]$. In finite elastic deformation theory, the transformation from undeformed ($\mathbf{X}$) configuration to deformed ($\mathbf{x}$) configuration is described by means of the deformation gradient tensor:
%
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{F} = \frac{\partial \mathbf{x}}{\partial\mathbf{X}}
\end{equation}

\noindent
The determinant of the deformation gradient $J:=\text{det}(\mathbf{F})$ measures the volume variation as the material undergoes deformation. Large deformation mechanics equations for an incompressible solid enforce the stress equilibrium with an incompressibility constraint:
%
\begin{equation}
    \nabla\cdot(J^{-1}\mathbf{F}\mathbf{T}\mathbf{F}^\mathsf{T}) = 0\,,\quad\text{with constraint}\quad J = 1
\end{equation}

\noindent
where $\mathbf{T}$ is the second Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor. The solution to the mechanics problem requires a description of the material behaviour known as the \textit{constitutive law}~\cite{BonetWood:2008}, which gives the stress tensor $\mathbf{T}$ as a function of the Green strain tensor $\mathbf{E}$ and the Cauchy strain tensor $\mathbf{C}$ for the material. The Green strain tensor is given as a function of the deformation gradient tensor:
%
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{E} = \frac{1}{2}\,(\mathbf{C}-\mathbf{I})\,,\quad\text{with}\quad \mathbf{C}=\mathbf{F}^T\mathbf{F}
\end{equation}

\noindent
and is transformed to a fibre-aligned coordinate system using $\mathbf{E^{fsn}}=\mathbf{L}^T\,\mathbf{E}\,\mathbf{L}$. The stress tensor $\mathbf{T^{fsn}}$ is determined from the constitutive law, which is generally expressed as a \textit{strain energy function} $W$:
%
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{T^{fsn}} = \derp{W}{\mathbf{E^{fsn}}}
\end{equation}

\noindent
The stress tensor $\mathbf{T^{fsn}}$ is then transformed back using $\mathbf{L}\,\mathbf{T^{fsn}}\,\mathbf{L}^T$. The final second Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor is obtained from the strain energy function by adding an active tension component $T_a$ (Section~\ref{sec:cell_contr_modelling}) along the fibres direction $\mathbf{f}$:
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:eqce}
    \mathbf{T} = \mathbf{L}\,\derp{W}{\mathbf{E^{fsn}}}\,\mathbf{L}^T + T_a\,\mathbf{ff}^T
\end{equation}

\noindent
$\mathbf{T}$ expresses the stresses in actively contracting incompressible cardiac tissue in terms of its strain and completes the set of equations required to model actively contracting cardiac tissue. The resulting system of equations is solved using the finite element method. A given displacement can be used to prescribe the position of the nodes at the computational domain boundaries (\textit{Dirichlet boundary conditions}).

\subsection{Haemodynamics}\label{sec:hemodynamics_math_modelling}
The blood pumped by the heart appears in electromechanical models as a mechanical boundary condition for the cavity pressure. During ejection, the change in pressure can be simulated using a Windkessel model~\cite{Westerhof:1971}. This framework models the aorta as a compliant vessel, which obeys
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:firstwkelem}
    p_{\textrm{ao}} = \frac{v_{\textrm{ao}}}{C}
\end{equation}

\noindent
where

\vspace{0.2cm}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
    $C$ & total arterial compliance \\
    $p_{\textrm{ao}}$ & aortic blood pressure \\
    $v_{\textrm{ao}}$ & aortic blood volume \\
\end{tabular}

\vspace{0.5cm}\noindent
Blood flow to the body is modelled using the simple \textit{Darcy's law of flow} which gives the flow as being proportional to the pressure drop between inlet and outlet pressures:
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:secondwkelem}
    I_{\textrm{out}} = \frac{p_{\textrm{ao}}-p_{\textrm{out}}}{R} 
\end{equation}

\noindent
where

\vspace{0.2cm}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
    $R$ & peripheral body vessels resistance \\
    $I_{\textrm{out}}$ & blood flow to the body \\
    $p_{\textrm{out}}$ & external pressure \\
\end{tabular}

\vspace{0.5cm}\noindent
The external pressure $p_{\textrm{out}}$ is assumed to be approximately equal to zero. Equations~\eqref{eq:firstwkelem}--\eqref{eq:secondwkelem} make up the \textit{two-element Windkessel model}. However, more realistic aortic pressure waves can be obtained by introducing a second resistance for the aortic valve, making up the \textit{three-element Windkessel model}:
%
\begin{align}\label{eq:windk}
    \der{v_{\textrm{LV}}}{t} &= \frac{1}{Z}\,(p_{\textrm{ao}}-p_{\textrm{LV}}) \\ 
    \der{v_{\textrm{ao}}}{t} &= -I_{\textrm{out}}-\der{v_{\textrm{LV}}}{t} \\
    I_{\textrm{out}} &= \frac{1}{R}\,p_{\textrm{ao}} \\
    p_{\textrm{ao}} &= \frac{1}{C}\,v_{\textrm{ao}}
\end{align}

\noindent
where

\vspace{0.2cm}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
    $Z$ & aortic characteristic impedance \\
    $p_{\textrm{LV}}$ & left-ventricular pressure \\
    $v_{\textrm{LV}}$ & left-ventricular volume
\end{tabular}

\vspace{0.5cm}\noindent
The three-element Windkessel model equations can also be re-written more concisely as:
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:windkconcise}
    \dder{v_{\textrm{LV}}}{t} = -\left(\frac{1}{C\,Z}+\frac{1}{R\,C}\right)\,\der{v_{\textrm{LV}}}{t}-\frac{1}{C\,Z\,R}\,p_{\textrm{LV}}-\frac{1}{Z}\,\der{p_{\textrm{LV}}}{t}
\end{equation}

\vspace{0.2cm}
Equation~\eqref{eq:windkconcise} can be further generalised to model simple haemodynamic boundary conditions during the other cardiac cycle phases as well, namely preload filling (to initialise the heart to a prescribed end-diastolic pressure), isovolumetric contraction, isovolumetric relaxation and diastolic filling:
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:windkgeneral}
    m_1\,\dder{v_{\textrm{LV}}}{t} + m_2\,\der{v_{\textrm{LV}}}{t} + m_3\,\der{p_{\textrm{LV}}}{t} + m_4\,v_{\textrm{LV}} + m_5\,p_{\textrm{LV}} +  m_6 = 0
\end{equation}

\noindent
This is done by solving~\eqref{eq:windkgeneral} with coefficients  $\mathbf{m}:=(m_1,\,\dots,\,m_6)\in\mathbb{R}^6$ adjusted according to the phase in the cardiac cycle as follows:
%
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{m} = \begin{cases}
    (0,\,0,\,1,\,0,\,0,\,0) & \rightarrow\quad\text{phase $0$: preload filling} \\
    (0,\,1,\,0,\,0,\,0,\,0) & \rightarrow\quad\text{phase $4$: isovolumetric contraction} \\
    (ZC,\,1+Z/R,\,C,\,0,\,1/R,\,0) & \rightarrow\quad\text{phase $1$: systolic ejection (equation~\eqref{eq:windkconcise})} \\
    (0,\,1,\,0,\,0,\,0,\,0) & \rightarrow\quad\text{phase $2$: isovolumetric relaxation} \\
    (0,\,0,\,1,\,0,\,\kappa_{\textrm{diast}},\,-p\cdot \kappa_{\textrm{diast}}) & \rightarrow\quad\text{phase $3$: diastolic filling}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}

\noindent
Briefly, the heart is inflated to a prescribed end-diastolic pressure ($p$) and stays in the diastolic phase ($\textrm{d}p_{\textrm{LV}}/\textrm{d}t=0$) until volume flow reverses. Next, isovolumetric contraction is simulated ($\textrm{d}v_{\textrm{LV}}/\textrm{d}t=0$) until the cavity pressure is high enough to open the aortic valve (prescribed $p_{\textrm{ao}}$ pressure). Ejection is simulated using the three-element Windkessel model~\eqref{eq:windkconcise}. When flow reverses once again, the constraint for isovolumetric relaxation is set ($\textrm{d}v_{\textrm{LV}}/\textrm{d}t=0$). When pressure finally relaxes below the prescribed $p$, a simple phenomenological model is used for diastole at a fixed $\kappa_{\textrm{diast}}$ inflation speed ($\textrm{d}p_{\textrm{LV}}/\textrm{d}t=\kappa_{\textrm{diast}}\,(p - p_{\textrm{LV}})$).

\section{Heart failure}\label{sec:ch1heart_failure}
Heart failure (\acs{HF}) is a chronic condition which occurs when the heart is unable to pump blood to meet the demands of the body. HF affects nearly a million people in the UK alone~\cite{Bhf:2021}, and increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases, stroke and death \cite{Adelborg:2017, Henkel:2008}. HF patients are commonly divided into two macro-categories according to two clearly distinct LV EF phenotypes. When HF is accompanied by a systolic dysfunction, the ventricular myocytes cannot contract properly due to insufficiently oxygenated or damaged tissue. This condition manifests as a lower than normal EF (normal is from $\SI{50}{\percent}$ to $\SI{70}{\percent}$) and is referred to as \textit{heart failure with reduced ejection fraction} (\acs{HFrEF}). When HF is accompanied by a diastolic dysfunction, the ventricular myocytes retain the ability to contract, but cannot relax properly due to thickened and stiff tissue. This condition presents a normal or even elevated EF, and is referred to as \textit{heart failure with preserved ejection fraction} (\acs{HFpEF}). Although LV EF value can be useful as an initial screening tool (e.g. $\textrm{EF}<\SI{50}{\percent}$ or $\textrm{EF}>\SI{50}{\percent}$), it cannot provide an accurate assessment of the whole cardiac function on its own~\cite{Guyton:2021}. HF is in fact an heterogeneous syndrome rather than a specific disease, and HF patients can exhibit multiple pathological conditions which are common in both the HFrEF and HFpEF diseases. Nevertheless, HFrEF and HFpEF patients often present distinct traits, medical history and co-morbidities, therefore the currently adopted pharmacological treatments for HF patients vary according to the EF phenotype. These are discussed in the next two paragraphs.


%
%
%
\subsection{HF with reduced ejection fraction}\label{sec:ch1HF_with_reduced_ejection_fraction}
The most common causes of HFrEF are decreased coronary blood flow due to ischaemic heart disease, damaged heart valves and primary cardiac muscle disease. The gold standard pharmacotherapies are beta-blockers, angiotensin receptor/neprilysin inhibitors, sodium-glucose co-transporter inhibitors, beta-blockers and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. These were all shown to improve the primary endpoint composite of cardiovascular death and HF hospitalisation in breakthrough clinical trials~\cite{Debska-Kozlowska:2021}.

\vspace{0.2cm}
Improved treatment strategies are constantly being sought for, and the Food and Drug Administration has recently stated~\cite{FDA:2019} that an improvement in symptoms and/or physical function, even without a documented favourable effect on the above mentioned primary endpoints, can be the basis for a drug to be approved as HF treatment~\cite{Fiuzat:2020}. For this reason, physiopathologic or "explanatory'' endpoints in the initial drug assessment phase and secondary endpoints in later phases have gained attention. Non-invasive measurements of the LV function such as cardiac output fall within these categories as targets for improvement (e.g. SV / EF)~\cite{Zanolla:2003}.

\vspace{0.2cm}
Novel strategies of HF treatment are being developed that tend to differ from the above mentioned pharmacotherapies which all agree to the well-accepted neurohormonal modulation paradigm, with direct sarcomere modulators being an important, example compound class in this direction~\cite{Tsukamoto:2020}. Sarcomere modulators' method of action rely on the fact that sarcomeric proteins dynamics are the basis of myocardial contraction and relaxation~\cite{Solaro:1998}. The two new compounds omecamtiv mecarbil~\cite{Teerlink:2016} and mavacamten~\cite{Olivotto:2020} provide new sarcomere modulators that can increase and decrease sarcomere activation by cardiac myosin stimulation and inhibition, respectively. Both these compounds alter myofilament $\Ca$ sensitivity, and knowing when and why this will result in improved cardiac function is an important question.


%
%

\subsection{HF with preserved ejection fraction}\label{sec:ch1HF_with_preserved_ejection_fraction}
HFpEF is a heterogeneous disease mainly attributed to LV diastolic dysfunction. Diastolic function worsens as part of normal ageing \cite{Andersen:2014} and this likely explains much of the age-association with increasing HFpEF risk. Other potentially prominent risk factors for HFpEF include obesity, metabolic syndrome, hypertension, sedentary state, coronary disease, kidney disease~\cite{Pfeffer:2019}. Hypertension is the dominant substrate upon which HFpEF develops, being present in $\SI{80}{\percent}-\SI{90}{\percent}$ of patients in community-based studies e.g.~\cite{Borlaug:2009}.

\vspace{0.2cm}
In HFpEF, there is an inability to enhance early diastolic relaxation and suction with exercise, contributing to increased filling pressures. There is also an increase in passive LV chamber stiffness in HFpEF, so that even if relaxation and suction were adequate, a higher filling pressure would be required to distend the chamber to an adequate preload volume. This increase in LV passive stiffness is related to changes in the extracellular matrix due to deposition of collagen (\textit{fibrosis})~\cite{Burlew:2002}, as well as changes within the cardiac myocyte, specifically abnormalities in $\Ca$ handling and phosphorylation status of titin. Typical structural changes associated with HFpEF are LA enlargement and LV hypertrophy, characterised by an enlargement or thickening of the heart muscle~\cite{Zile:2004}, although investigations in broader HFpEF samples have established a much more heterogeneous cardiac phenotype, characterised by many patterns of cardiac remodelling including no remodelling at all~\cite{Shah:2012}.

\vspace{0.2cm}
There are limited evidence-based pharmacotherapies for HFpEF. This may be due to the disparateness of the disease as well as its multifactorial pathophysiology. Patients currently receive either angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/aldosterone receptor blockers, $\Ca$ channel blockers or beta-blockers, but the mortality and the morbidity associated with the disease have so far remained high~\cite{Adamczak:2020}. Therefore, patients with HFpEF are
currently considered the largest unmet need in cardiology~\cite{Owan:2006}.

\vspace{0.2cm}
Previously, HFpEF was thought to result from solely diastolic dysfunction and LV hypertrophy~\cite{Patel:2019}. However, therapies within this conceptual framework were not successful~\cite{Cleland:2014}. Recently, a combination of immune dysregulation and inflammation that leads to systemic microvascular endothelial dysfunction in various organ systems has been proposed as cause of HFpEF. There are now $\sim 20$ pharmacotherapeutic clinical trials targeting signalling mechanisms along this cascade. Two of these aim at blocking IL-1, a pro-inflammatory cytokine that inhibits the L-type $\Ca$ channels, and at inhibiting the late inward $\Na$ current, respectively. Both the therapies are expected to prevent cytosolic $\Ca$ overload, which may in turn improve LV relaxation (or \textit{lusitropy}).

\vspace{0.2cm}
Targeting $\Ca$ handling is already subject of different clinical trials. On the other hand, the possibility to target the sarcomere to treat different cardiovascular pathologies including HFpEF by dynamically modulating its constituent proteins is an ongoing investigation~\cite{Patel:2019}. Recent attempts of targeting the sarcomere have seen mavacamten and omecamtiv as protagonists (Section~\ref{sec:ch1HF_with_reduced_ejection_fraction}), although used as an indirect treatment for HFpEF. In fact, only a chronic administration of mavacamten has been seen to reduce be beneficial in the presence of LV hypertrophy~\cite{Green:2016}, while only in the presence of RV failure an HFpEF patient could benefit from increased RV contractility through omecamtiv action~\cite{Planelles-Herrero:2017}.

\subsection{Quantitatively linking cell, tissue and haemodynamic properties to whole heart function}
The whole heart contraction is the result of complex molecular mechanisms and electromechanical events at the cellular level. The organ-scale function is thus strongly dependent on and can be manipulated by cellular manipulations, yet quantitatively mapping changes in one part of this system to another to understand their role in disease or predicting how changing a single protein's function may affect whole organ function is complex and is not susceptible to intuitive analysis. For this reason, the main purpose of this thesis is to develop a computational framework to quantitatively link pathological and pharmacological manipulations across scales and physics in the heart, from single cell up to whole organ. To do this, we propose to build a biophysically detailed $3$D mathematical model of the rat heart. By improving our understanding of the transduction of the electrical signal and sarcomere function through to whole-organ function in both healthy and diseased states, we hope to provide a virtual platform to test hypotheses and to possibly identify potential targets for treating HF.


%
%
%
\subsection{In silico identification of potential pharmacological targets for HF treatment}
To build this virtual platform, currently available mathematical models of the heart have to be tuned to experimental measurements of the real world biological system they aim at representing. Assessing how variability in a model input can impact our confidence in model predictions is another important issue. Calibrating detailed models to biological data with uncertainty and then propagating this uncertainty forward into model predictions represents a significant methodological and computational challenge, which we aim to address with this thesis work.

\section{Summary}\label{sec:ch1summary}
The heart is a complex system where many different mechanisms at the sub-cellular, cellular, tissue and whole-organ scales interplay to yield a coordinated contraction and relaxation. We have described the heart physiology at each of these scales, and we have shown how current biophysically-detailed computational bio-electro-mechanics models are able to capture the main biological phenomena to represent the heart function \textit{in silico}. We have introduced the HF syndrome, which encompasses a large variety of diseases, empathising the need of having a virtual platform to be able to reproduce the heart characteristic pathophysiological mechanisms to guide preclinical research towards better HF pharmacological treatments.
